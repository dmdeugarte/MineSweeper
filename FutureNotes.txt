plz note that @ Board.java:23 a NullPointerException is experienced due to Tile being instantiated via reference.
All Tiles should be initialized prior to populating the field.

08/08/19 - ALL ABOVE FIXED
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tile:boolean isSeen is in the code, and should be implemented w/in Board's printField. 

Board: reveal(int a, int b) should be added, with a while loop that finds all nearby 0's, opens those, and reveals their surroundings,
w/ exception to the mines themselves(designated as a 9)
if reveal(int,int) is used on a mine, the game quits, and reveals the whole board.
add a count that adds up the number of marked tiles(keep in mind that some could be unmarked again). 

add to Board: setMineStatus(int, int, boolean) to, if the number of marked tiles == the number of mines(add that as a private int), 
then check to see if all mines are marked. If so, game quits, if not, no.

add to Game - 
add an open Menu w/ size(add a checker w/in a while loop) and number of mines. 
This should randomly spit out a location, check to see if it is a '0' Tile, and reveal it
Then, each 'round', the game will print the board and a new menu(revealTile, markTile, quit), and a tally of unused 'markers'.

 - None of the above is added
 - Created a new txt doc for update logs

The reveal idea should be recursive. Start with a tile that reads 0. Check tile Northwest and move right-to-left, top-to-bottom. Check for existence first, then check for number. If the number is 0, begin the recursive process again. Otherwise, if it is not a 9, call setSeen on that tile and retreat. 

I will rewrite most of this to have and array of JavaButtons and Listeners. The buttons will represent the Tile information. If visible, show the num value. Otherwise, show the isMarked value. A marked value should be... Well, use the current printField method in Board.java to show this. An x is marked, and = is unmarked. 

This buttons thing will also have a couple of text fields and possible a popup menu to change the settings of the game.

2020.12.17
 - BoardTest.java created for testing of Button array
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Potentially, I will need both the Button's 1D array and the tileArray's 2D array. The 2D will be used to figure out what to clear when you reveal a tile, plus is required for cataloguing the numbers for each Tile. Then, that will be used by the array of buttons for their text. I've created a couple methods that will turn a number into the 1D number and back to the set of 2D positions for that purpose. 

I will need to test if having everything static or not will change anything. I doubt it, so I will leave it for now, but I should test later. Static is supposed to make things a tad more efficient. 

I will need to create new, recursive revealTile method eventually. That will be once the BoardTest.java catches up to the abilities of the actual Board.java. I can test it now, but I will wait.

Possible Bugs: 
- Not enough mines generated. Needs further investigating. Possibly fixed.

To Implement:
- JTextFields in northPanel need functionality
- Hotkey required for toggling markOrReveal JButton. Frustrating to go back and forth from it.
- Recursive revealTile should be written and implemented.
- Merge BoardTest with Board. Delete all .java files except Tile and newly merged Board.
- Make icons for each button. Flag, hidden and revealed mine.
- Possible change quitReveal to only reveal flagged or hidden mines and not reveal all tiles?
