plz note that @ Board.java:23 a NullPointerException is experienced due to Tile being instantiated via reference.
All Tiles should be initialized prior to populating the field.

Tile:boolean isSeen is in the code, and should be implemented w/in Board's printField. 

Board: reveal(int a, int b) should be added, with a while loop that finds all nearby 0's, opens those, and reveals their surroundings,
w/ exception to the mines themselves(designated as a 9)
if reveal(int,int) is used on a mine, the game quits, and reveals the whole board.
add a count that adds up the number of marked tiles(keep in mind that some could be unmarked again). 

add to Board: setMineStatus(int, int, boolean) to, if the number of marked tiles == the number of mines(add that as a private int), 
then check to see if all mines are marked. If so, game quits, if not, no.

add to Game - 
add an open Menu w/ size(add a checker w/in a while loop) and number of mines. 
This should randomly spit out a location, check to see if it is a '0' Tile, and reveal it
Then, each 'round', the game will print the board and a new menu(revealTile, markTile, quit), and a tally of unused 'markers'.

 - None of the above is added
 - Created a new txt doc for update logs

The reveal idea should be recursive. Start with a tile that reads 0. Check tile Northwest and move right-to-left, top-to-bottom. Check for existence first, then check for number. If the number is 0, begin the recursive process again. Otherwise, if it is not a 9, call setSeen on that tile and retreat. 

I will rewrite most of this to have and array of JavaButtons and Listeners. The buttons will represent the Tile information. If visible, show the num value. Otherwise, show the isMarked value. A marked value should be... Well, use the current printField method in Board.java to show this. An x is marked, and = is unmarked. 

This buttons thing will also have a couple of text fields and possible a popup menu to change the settings of the game.
